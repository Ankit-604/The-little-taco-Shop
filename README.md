# The Little Taco Shop

This is my first HTML project. In this project, I have created a small web page for "Little Taco Shop". I have used HTML, minimal CSS, some images of tacos, and a taco emoji to bring this project to life.

As this is my first project, I have been learning HTML since last week. Dave Gray's channel assisted me a lot during this time. You can check out his channel [here](https://youtu.be/mJgBOIoGihA).
